# Prime Number

## About Prime Number

This is a project I made for my computer programming class using C++.
This project was created for one of my labs in my class and
follows exactly what my professor asked to be designed. I am
limited on the methods and techniques I can use based on what we 
have covered in our class textbook.

The instructions were to create a prime number checker. The program
will prompt the user to enter two positive integer numbers lower than
1,000,000. The program will then check the prime numbers and return
the twin primes.

## Getting Started

This is a standalone application, no installation is required.

1. Download the file
> [Click to Download](https://github.com/ant-cantu/2-5_Prime-Number/blob/main/L2-5.exe)

2. Run the application.
3. Review the prompt.
4. Input two positive integers.
5. Review the output.
6. Exit the application.

## Usage

The purpose of this application is to output the twin prime numbers
between two positive integer numbers. The sum of all prime numbers
will be displayed along with the total amount of twin prime numbers.
Each twin prime will be displayed as well.
